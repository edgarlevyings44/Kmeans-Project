# Kmeans-Project
The objective of this project is to determine if machine learning can detect fake bank notes. Since data science is fueled by data, it was essential to collect and digitize hundreds of notes of images of genuine and forged banknotes. Wavelets, a mathematical tool were used to extract information from many different kinds of data, including images. Wavelets were used to extract features from our images. Using KÂ¬means clustering, we can organize the data into two clusters; one which contains the wavelets of the real bank notes and one that contains wavelets of fake bank notes, using this analysis we could determine an algorithm to detect fake notes based on wavelet data.
